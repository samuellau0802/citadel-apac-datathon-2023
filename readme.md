## Report Outline

### EDA, Visualization
1. Heatmap
2. Feature Importance
3. Map visuals

### Data Preprocessing
- Link car crash, crime and traffic stop data using police district
- each input data represent the stats of a police district in a period of time (by month/weekday?)


### Hypothesis Testing
- We selectively choose 1-2 features and test their correlation to car crash (severity/frequency)

### Model Fitting
1. x: feature matrix from the data preprocessing part
2. y: number of car crash / car crash severity level

### Optimization
- Based on the number of car crash and the severity level, how could we effectively allocation the traffic police in each police district?
